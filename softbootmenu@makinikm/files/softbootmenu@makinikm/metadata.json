    "description": "Panel Tray Menu applet for soft-rebooting into installed kernel(s) using kexec.",
    "comments": "This applet is a wrapper for 'kexec-tools' and 'systemctl kexec' commands, preserving the running kernel's boot arguments (`--reuse-cmdline`). These commands load a kernel image into memory (along the running kernel) and gracefully switch to it using systemd - services are stopped as for reboot, and the initialization is then handed over to the new kernel. Although kexec patches in the mainline kernel are over a decade old and systemd's kexec command is long stable, using kexec for such purposes without a hardware reboot could possibly leave your system unresponsive, potentially cause data corruption or render it unbootable. Despite the rarity of such cases, not all hardware configurations and system setups or drivers support kexec reboot, especially ones using some proprietary dkms modules (e.g. Nvidia, AMD). Highly advisable to test kexec functionality manually on your system before using this Applet.",
